# Pacmen
## Description
Creates pacmen on a screen 
There are 2 buttons; one that adds pacmen and one that starts the game.
The pacmen move at random velocities and bounce off of the sides of the screen. 

###Roadmap of future improvements:
I would like to have the pacmen face the direction the are going.
A stop and reset button would be nice as well
